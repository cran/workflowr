In this example, `cache=TRUE` is set globally, which should result in a warning
for each chunk expect the third which has `autodep=TRUE`. The inserted
sessioninfo chunk will also get a warning (thus 3 total).

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```

```{r plot-one}
plot(1:10)
```

```{r plot-two}
plot(1:10)
```

```{r plot-three, autodep=TRUE}
plot(1:10)
```
