## Why isn't my website displaying online?

Occasionally your website may not display (or recent updates will not
immediately appear), and you may even receive an email from GitHub with the
following message:

> The page build failed for the `master` branch with the following error:
>
> unable to build page. Please try again later.
>
> For information on troubleshooting Jekyll see:
>
>   https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-jekyll-builds
>
> If you have any questions you can contact us by replying to this email.

If you've followed the setup instructions from the [Getting started
vignette](wflow-01-getting-started.html), and especially if the website
displayed in the past, it's _very unlikely_ that you caused the problem. The
hosting is provided by [GitHub Pages][gh-pages], and it sometimes is delayed or
down. Overall for a free service, it is very reliable. If you wait 5 minutes (or
30 minutes at most), your website will likely be back to normal.

If you are anxious to know if there is a problem and when it will be resolved,
you can check the status of the Twitter account [GitHub Status][gh-status] for
the most up-to-date reports from GitHub. If you suspect that the problem may
have been caused by your recent changes to your website (again, this is
unlikely), you can view the GitHub help page [Troubleshooting GitHub Pages
builds][gh-troubleshooting].

## Can I make my workflowr website private?

Short answer: Not if you use the default setup that deploys the site on GitHub
Pages. For alternative deployment options, see the vignette [Alternative
strategies for deploying workflowr websites][vig-deploy]. It includes options
for public or private websites.

Long answer: Even if you create a private GitHub repository, the website it
creates is still public. If you're not ready to publish your results online, you
can always wait and activate GitHub Pages later. In the meantime, you'll still
have a version-controlled, organized set of results for your project. However,
the risk that someone that doesn't have the link to your website is able to find
it is very low. Search engines prioritize the results by how many other sites
link to a site, so your website will not be high in the results even if you
search for very specific terms. Thus if you only share the URL to your results
with your close collaborators, and request that they not share it widely, your
website is effectively private. That being said, being truly scooped in science
is rare (at best) and openly sharing your work will help establish your
expertise in the field (and furthermore establishes your priority), so you
should consider keeping both your code and website public. The main caveat to
this advice is if you are analyzing data that contains sensitive or restricted
information, in which case you should not use GitHub Pages or any other public
deployment option.

## How should I manage large data files in a workflowr project?

Tracking the changes to your project's large data files is critical for
reproducibility. Unfortunately Git, which is the version control software used
by workflowr, was designed to version small files containing code. See the
vignette [Using large data files with workflowr][vig-data] for various options
for versioning the large data files used in your workflowr project.

## How can I include external images in my website?

Image files that are generated by the code executed in the R Markdown files are
automatically handled by workflowr. If you'd like to include additional image
files to be displayed in your webpages, follow these steps:

1. Create an assets directory to include any file that should be part of the
website but is not created by the R Markdown files in `analysis/`:

    ```
    dir.create("docs/assets")
    ```
1. Move the image file(s) to `docs/assets/`
1. In the R Markdown file, refer to the image file(s) using the relative path
from `docs/` (because this is where the HTML files are located), e.g.:

    ```
    ![](assets/external.png)
    ```
    Alternatively, you could use `knitr::include_graphics()` inside of an R code
    chunk, which will automatically center the image and also follow the knitr
    chunk options `out.width` and `out.height`:

    ```
    knitr::include_graphics("assets/external.png")
    ```
    Note that the image will not be previewed in the R Markdown file inside of
    RStudio because it is in a different directory than the R Markdown file.
1. Run `wflow_build()` to confirm the external image file(s) are properly
displayed
1. Use `wflow_git_commit()` to commit the file(s) to the Git repo (so that they
get pushed to GitHub):

    ```
    wflow_git_commit("docs/assets/external.png", "Add external image of ...")
    # If you are adding multiple files, you could use a file glob
    wflow_git_commit("docs/assets/*.png", "Add external images of ...")
    ```
1. Run `wflow_publish()` on the R Markdown file that contains the external
image file(s)

## How can I save a figure in a vector graphics format (e.g. PDF)?

The default file format is PNG. This is ideal for displaying figure files on a
web page. However, you might need to import a figure into a vector graphics
editor (e.g. Illustrator, Inkscape) for final editing for a manuscript. There
are multiple options for achieving this.

One option is to switch to the file format SVG. It is a vector graphics format
that is also well supported by web browsers. The code chunk below saves the
figure file as an SVG:

````
```{r plot-for-paper, dev='svg'}`r ''`
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) + geom_point()
p
```
````

To apply this to every figure file in a particular document, you can create a
"setup" chunk at the beginning of the document that sets the [knitr chunk
option](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) globally:

````
```{r setup, dev='svg'}`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = 'svg')
```
````

Another option is to simultaneously create a PNG for display in the web page and
a PDF for further editing. The example code below saves both a PNG and PDF
version of the figure, but inserts the PNG into the web page:

````
```{r plot-for-paper, dev=c('png', 'pdf')}`r ''`
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) + geom_point()
p
```
````

The main advantage of the above approaches is that the figure files are still
saved in an organized fashion (i.e. the file path is still something like
`docs/figure/file.Rmd/chunk-name.ext`). Furthermore, `wflow_publish()` will
automatically version the figure files regardless of the file extension.

A similar option to the one above is to have two separate code chunks. The
advantage of this more verbose option is that you can specify different chunk
names (and thus different filenames) and also set different `fig.width` and
`fig.height` for the website and paper versions. By setting `include=FALSE` for
the second chunk, neither the code nor the PDF figure file is displayed in the
web page.

````
```{r plot-for-paper}`r ''`
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) + geom_point()
p
```
````

````
```{r figure1A, include=FALSE, dev='pdf', fig.height=3, fig.width=9}`r ''`
p
```
````

However, for the most control, you can always save the figure manually, e.g.
using `ggsave()`. For example, the example chunk below creates a 10x10 inch PNG
file that is automatically versioned by workflowr, but also uses `ggsave()` to
save a 5x5 inch PDF file in the subdirectory `paper/` (which would need to be
manually committed by the user, e.g. with `wflow_git_commit()`):

````
```{r plot-for-paper, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}`r ''`
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) + geom_point()
p
ggsave("paper/plot-to-edit.pdf", width = 5, height = 5)
```
````

## Can I include Shiny apps in my website?

No, at least not in the standard setup. The website is hosted with GitHub pages,
which only supports static web pages. Shiny apps are dynamic, i.e. a user can
interact with them to change the content. The easiest way to share your Shiny
app would be to host it at [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/) and add a
link to your app on your workflowr website. Alternatively you could host your
workflowr website on your own server, but that would require much more knowledge
and resources to accomplish.

## Can I change "X" on my website?

Almost certainly yes, but some things are easier to customize than others. The
vignette [Customize your research website](wflow-02-customization.html) provides
some ideas that are simple to implement. Check out the documentation for
[rmarkdown][] and [Twitter Bootstrap][Bootstrap] for inspiration.

## How can I suppress the workflowr report?

To suppress the insertion of the workflowr report for all of the files in your
project, activate the option `suppress_report` in the `_workflowr.yml` file by
adding the following line:

```
suppress_report: TRUE
```

And then republishing your project:

```
wflow_publish("_workflowr.yml", republish = TRUE)
```

To suppress the workflowr report only for a specific file, add the following
lines to its YAML header:

```
workflowr:
  suppress_report: TRUE
```

## Why am I not getting the same result with wflow_build() as with the RStudio Knit HTML button?

`wflow_build()` is designed to have the same functionality as the Knit HTML
button in RStudio, namely that it knits the HTML file in a separate R session to
avoid any clashes with variables or packages in use in the current R session.
However, the technical implementations are not identical, and thus informally we
have noticed the behavior of the two options occasionally differs. At the
moment, we believe that if the file results in an error when using
`wflow_build()`, the file needs to be fixed, regardless of whether the file is
able to be built with the RStudio button. If you have a use case that you think
should be supported by `wflow_build()`, please open an [Issue][issues] and
provide a small reproducible example.

## Can I share workflowr websites directly with collaborators in a secure fashion?

Yes. Please see these [instructions][deploy-beaker] for deploying a workflowr
project securely with [Beaker Browser][beaker].

## Can I password-protect my website?

Yes. Please see these [instructions][deploy-aws] for deploying a workflowr
project with password-protection using [Amazon S3][s3].

## How should I install packages to use with a workflowr project?

When you start a new workflowr project with `wflow_start()`, it automatically
creates a local `.Rprofile` file that only affects your R session when you run R
from within your workflowr project. This is why you see the following lines each
time you open R:

```
Loading .Rprofile for the current workflowr project
This is workflowr version 1.3.0
Run ?workflowr for help getting started
>
```

This is intended to be a convenience so that you don't have to type
`library(workflowr)` every time you return to your project (or restart your R
session). However, the downside is that this has the potential to cause problems
when you install new packages. If you attempt to install one of the packages
that workflowr depends on, or if you attempt to install a package that then
updates one of these dependencies, this may cause an error. For example, here is
a typical error caused by updating git2r when the workflowr package is loaded:

```
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘git2r’ in get(method, envir = home):
 lazy-load database '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/git2r/R/git2r.rdb' is corrupt
In addition: Warning message:
In get(method, envir = home) : internal error -3 in R_decompress1
```

The short term solution is to restart your current R session, which should fix
everything. In the long term, if you start to get this type of error often, you
can try one of the following strategies:

1. Always restart your R session after installing new packages
(Ctrl/Command+Shift+F10 in RStudio)
1. Open R from a directory that is not a workflowr project when installing new
packages
1. Delete `.Rprofile` with `wflow_remove(".Rprofile")` and manually load
workflowr with `library(workflowr)` every time you start a new R session


## Can I create a single HTML or PDF file of one of my workflowr R Markdown files?

Yes! If you'd like to create a single HTML or PDF file to distribute an isolated
analysis from your project, you can directly run the [rmarkdown][] function
`render`.

```{r render-single-page, eval=FALSE}
library("rmarkdown")
# Create analysis/file.html
render("analysis/file.Rmd", html_document())
# Create analysis/file.pdf
render("analysis/file.Rmd", pdf_document())
```

There are two main caveats to this:

1. Internal links to other HTML pages in your workflowr site will be broken
since they are not being distributed with the single file.
1. An R Markdown file that can be converted to HTML is not guaranteed to be
converted to PDF. You'll need to ensure that you have LaTeX installed on your
computer and avoid complicated characters and/or syntax.

If you'd like to use the RStudio button "Knit to PDF", then you need to make
sure that the YAML header still contains the workflowr output format. For
example, the YAML header below contains a valid output section:

```
---
output:
  pdf_document: default
  workflowr::wflow_html: default
---
```

## Can I use R notebooks with workflowr?

Yes! You can use RStudio's notebook features while you interactively develop
your analysis, either directly using the output format
`rmarkdown::html_notebook()` or indirectly with "inline code chunks" in your R
Markdown files. However, you need to take a few precautions to make sure your
notebook-style usage is compatible with the workflowr options.

First note that the R Markdown files created by `wflow_start()` and
`wflow_open()` include the lines below in the YAML header. These purposefully
disable inline code chunks to proactively prevent any potential
incompatibilities with workflowr. To activate inline code chunks, you can either
delete these two lines or replace `console` with `inline`.

```
editor_options:
  chunk_output_type: console
```

Second, note that the working directory of the inline code chunks can be
different than the working directory of the R console. This is very
counterintuitive, but the working directory of the inline code chunks is set by
the "Knit Directory" setting in RStudio. The setting of "Knit Directory" may be
different in your collaborator's version of RStudio, or even your own RStudio
installed on a different computer. Thus it's not a good idea to rely on this
value. Instead, you can explicitly specify the working directory to be used for
the inline code chunks by setting the knitr option `root.dir` in a chunk called
`setup`, which RStudio treats specially. Adding the code chunk below to your R
Markdown file will cause all the inline code chunks to be executed from the root
of the project directory. This is consistent with the default workflowr setting.

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "..")
```
````

If you change the value of `knit_root_dir` in `_workflowr.yml`, then you would
need to change the value of `root.dir` in the setup chunk accordingly. Warning
that this is fragile, i.e. trying to change `root.dir` to any arbitrary
directory may result in an error. If you're going to use inline code chunks,
it's best two follow one of the following options:

1. Execute code in the root of the project directory (the default workflowr
setting). Don't change `knit_root_dir` in `_workflowr.yml`. Add the setup chunk
defined above to your R Markdown files. Note that this setup chunk will affect
RStudio but not the workflowr functions `wflow_build()` or `wflow_publish()`.

2. Execute code in the R Markdown directory (named `analysis/` by default).
Delete the `knit_root_dir` entry in `_workflowr.yml`. Don't explicitly set
`root.dir` in a setup code chunk in your R Markdown files. Ensure that the
RStudio setting "Knit Directory" is set to "Document Directory".

Third, note that if you are using `html_notebook()`, any settings you specify
for it will be ignored when you run `wflow_build()` or `wflow_publish()`. This
is because the settings in `_site.yml` override them. If you wish to change the
setting of one particular notebook file, as opposed to every file in your
project, you can set it with `workflowr::wflow_html()`. For example, if you want
to enable folding of code chunks and disable the table of contents for only this
file, you could use the following YAML header.

```
---
title: "Using R Notebook with workflowr"
output:
  html_notebook: default
  workflowr::wflow_html:
    toc: false
    code_folding: show
---
```

## How should I pronounce and spell workflowr?

There are multiple options for pronouncing workflowr:

1. workflow + er
1. workflow + R
1. work + flower

I (John) started primarily saying "workflow + er" but have more recently
transitioned to saying "workflow + R" more often. You can choose whichever is
most natural to you.

Workflowr should be capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, but otherwise
the lowercase workflowr should be the preferred option.
