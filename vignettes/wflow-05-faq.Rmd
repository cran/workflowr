## Why isn't my website displaying online?

Occasionally your website may not display (or recent updates will not
immediately appear), and you may even receive an email from GitHub with the
following message:

> The page build failed for the `master` branch with the following error:
>
> unable to build page. Please try again later.
>
> For information on troubleshooting Jekyll see:

>   https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-jekyll-builds
>
> If you have any questions you can contact us by replying to this email.

If you've followed the setup instructions from the [Getting started
vignette](wflow-01-getting-started.html), and especially if the website
displayed in the past, it's _very unlikely_ that you caused the problem. The
hosting is provided by [GitHub Pages][gh-pages], and it sometimes is delayed or
down. Overall for a free service, it is very reliable. If you wait 5 minutes (or
30 minutes at most), your website will likely be back to normal.

If you are anxious to know if there is a problem and when it will be resolved,
you can check the status of the Twitter account [GitHub Status][gh-status] for
the most up-to-date reports from GitHub. If you suspect that the problem may
have been caused by your recent changes to your website (again, this is
unlikely), you can view the GitHub help page [Troubleshooting GitHub Pages
builds][gh-troubleshooting].

## Can I make my workflowr website private?

Short answer: Not if you use the default setup that deploys the site on GitHub
Pages. For alternative deployment options, see the vignette [Alternative
strategies for deploying workflowr websites][vig-deploy]. It includes options
for public or private websites.

Long answer: Even if you create a private GitHub repository, the website it
creates is still public. If you're not ready to publish your results online, you
can always wait and activate GitHub Pages later. In the meantime, you'll still
have a version-controlled, organized set of results for your project. However,
the risk that someone that doesn't have the link to your website is able to find
it is very low. Search engines prioritize the results by how many other sites
link to a site, so your website will not be high in the results even if you
search for very specific terms. Thus if you only share the URL to your results
with your close collaborators, and request that they not share it widely, your
website is effectively private. That being said, being truly scooped in science
is rare (at best) and openly sharing your work will help establish your
expertise in the field (and furthermore establishes your priority), so you
should consider keeping both your code and website public. The main caveat to
this advice is if you are analyzing data that contains sensitive or restricted
information, in which case you should not use GitHub Pages or any other public
deployment option.

## How can I include external images in my website?

Image files that are generated by the code executed in the R Markdown files are
automatically handled by workflowr. If you'd like to include additional image
files to be displayed in your webpages, follow these steps:

1. Create an assets directory to include any file that should be part of the
website but is not created by the R Markdown files in `analysis/`:
    ```
   dir.create("docs/assets")
    ```
1. Move the image file(s) to `docs/assets/`
1. In the R Markdown file, refer to the image file(s) using the relative path
from `docs/` (because this is where the HTML files are located), e.g.:
    ```
   ![](assets/external.png)
    ```
1. Run `wflow_build()` to confirm the external image file(s) are properly
displayed
1. Use `wflow_git_commit()` to commit the file(s) to the Git repo (so that they
get pushed to GitHub):
    ```
   wflow_git_commit("docs/assets/external.png", "Add external image of ...")
   # If you are adding multiple files, you could use a file glob
   wflow_git_commit("docs/assets/*.png", "Add external images of ...")
    ```
1. Run `wflow_publish()` on the R Markdown file that contains the external
image file(s)

## Can I include Shiny apps in my website?

No, at least not in the standard setup. The website is hosted with GitHub pages,
which only supports static web pages. Shiny apps are dynamic, i.e. a user can
interact with them to change the content. The easiest way to share your Shiny
app would be to host it at [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/) and add a
link to your app on your workflowr website. Alternatively you could host your
workflowr website on your own server, but that would require much more knowledge
and resources to accomplish.

## Can I change "X" on my website?

Almost certainly yes, but some things are easier to customize than others. The
vignette [Customize your research website](wflow-02-customization.html) provides
some ideas that are simple to implement. Check out the documentation for
[rmarkdown][] and [Twitter Bootstrap][Bootstrap] for inspiration.

## Why am I not getting the same result with wflow_build() as with the RStudio Knit HTML button?

`wflow_build()` is designed to have the same functionality as the Knit HTML
button in RStudio, namely that it knits the HTML file in a separate R session to
avoid any clashes with variables or pacakges in use in the current R session.
However, the technical implementations are not identical, and thus informally we
have noticed the behavior of the two options occassionally differs. At the
moment, we believe that if the file results in an error when using
`wflow_build()`, the file needs to be fixed, regardless of whether the file is
able to be built with the RStudio button. If you have a use case that you think
should be supported by `wflow_build()`, please open an [Issue][issues] and
provide a small reproducible example.

## Can I share workflowr websites directly with collaborators in a secure fashion?

Yes. Please see these [instructions][deploy-beaker] for deploying a workflowr
project securely with [Beaker Browser][beaker].

## Can I password-protect my website?

Yes. Please see these [instructions][deploy-aws] for deploying a workflowr
project with password-protection using [Amazon S3][s3].



## Can I create a single HTML or PDF file of one of my workflowr R Markdown files?

Yes! If you'd like to create a single HTML or PDF file to distribute an isolated
analysis from your project, you can directly run the [rmarkdown][] function
`render`.

```{r render-single-page, eval=FALSE}
library("rmarkdown")
# Create analysis/file.html
render("analysis/file.Rmd", html_document())
# Create analysis/file.pdf
render("analysis/file.Rmd", pdf_document())
```

There are two main caveats to this:

1. Internal links to other HTML pages in your workflowr site will be broken
since they are not being distributed with the single file.
1. An R Markdown file that can be converted to HTML is not guaranteed to be
converted to PDF. You'll need to ensure that you have LaTeX installed on your
computer and avoid complicated characters and/or syntax.

## How should I pronounce and spell workflowr?

You can say "workflowr + er" or "workflowr + R", whichever is more natural to
you.

Workflowr should be capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, but otherwise
the lowercase workflowr should be the preferred option.
